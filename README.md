This repository provides the source code for the GreekAlphabetLearner tool which is written in Java

This is my first project JavaFX project and is aimed for People who try to learn a diffrent Alphabet. Instead of using old notecards you can just place your images inside _/symbols_ and start learning your Alphabet.



### Usage
> Just place your alphabet inside the /symbols folder and let the magic begin.
Important NOTE: the filenames need to be named as the result that has to be checked otherwise it will obv. not work.

Please provide your images with basic syntax like 

    Alpha.jpg


### Installation:
